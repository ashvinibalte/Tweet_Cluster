Tweet Cluster Project
Overview
The Tweet Cluster project is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze and cluster tweets based on their content. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide meaningful insights into large datasets of tweets.

Project Details
Repository
GitHub Repository: Tweet Cluster

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilized for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
Machine Learning: Clustering algorithms to group similar tweets.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Features
Data Collection: Scripts to fetch tweets from Twitter API.
Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical form.
Clustering: Implementation of clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN to group tweets with similar content.
Visualization: Visual representation of clusters using various plotting libraries.
Evaluation: Metrics and methods to evaluate the quality and relevance of clusters.
